## Description

Personal website developed from scratch in which I present myself in more detail both in terms of my training and my professional career. This site also allows me to highlight the different projects I have worked on, be it school projects or personal projects.

To create this site, I decided to use the front-end framwork **NuxtJS** because it offers a static configuration and it allows me to scale easily, for example by using a SPA if necessary.

Technologies used:

- NuxtJS
- NuxtJS Content
- NuxtJS i18n
- SCSS

Hosted on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/cyril-lajarge/deploys) <img src="https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/415b6f97-9499-4899-b591-4c8ea61c9455/deploy-status" alt="Netlify Status Badge" class="normal-img" />.

The source code is open-source and availabel on [Github](https://github.com/cyrillajarge/personal-website).
