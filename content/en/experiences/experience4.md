Since november 2021, I am a software engineer at **Euro-Information, Crédit Mutuel Alliance Fédérale's technology subsidiary**.
I work in the specific applications department in the team responsible for managing the information system of a major motorway toll company in Europe. The company enables its customers to pay for toll consumption, or road taxes in force in certain countries, using a single electronic toll device and therefore a single invoice. The company is constantly growing. Its goal is to offer an interoperability across all Europe to its customers.

The company's business requires it to process very large volumes of data. Indeed, trucks are on the road almost 24/7 and the system needs to be able to integrate and process toll consumption as well as GPS positions in almost real-time. Moreover, the declaration of these toll consumption to government entities of different countries has to be done within a very short time, under penalty of heavy fines. In that way, the processes must be high-performance and robust in order to offer a quality service to customers.

I work across the entire information system through :

- The analysis and the development of functional evolutions
- The maintenance and the optimization of existing processes
- The analysis and the correction of incidents
- The management of data reporting processes (ETL)

- Development of high-availability windows services (multi-servers and multi-threads) with monitoring systems in case of errors in the processes
- Development of SOAP & REST APIs using C#
- Implementation of web sites using a front-end proprietary framework based on the MVC model (XML, XAML, C#)
- Elaboration of optimized Transact-SQL procedures on large databases (10M+ records) with fast query requirements.
- Construction and monitoring of ETL jobs using SAP Business Objects
