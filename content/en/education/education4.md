Middle school and high school at the European School of Strasbourg.

The strengths of education at the European School are a wide choice of learning options and quality language teaching. I have chosen as my first foreign language **German** and as my second foreign language **English**. I have also had 2 years of lessons on a third foreign language: **Spanish**. The history and geography courses are taught in the first foreign language. Because of the strong diversity present in a European school, an intercultural exchange between students from many European countries is permanent. In addition, scientific teaching is demanding. I have chosen a **strengthened science curriculum** with reinforced courses in math and physics.

**European Baccalaureate acquired** with a final grade of 84.86/100. I also had the honor to receive the **Science Award** for my results in scientific subjects.
