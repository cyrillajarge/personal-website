Master of Engineering in computer science with a specialization in image based on the I3D master's degree from the University of Strasbourg (CMI IIRVIJ).

The CMI ("Cursus Master en Ing√©nierie") is a five-year reinforced bachelor's-master's degree course offered by a network of universities (www.reseau-figure.fr) which covers the fields of engineering and prepares its students for the integration into innovative companies or research laboratories. A national reference system guarantees the balance of the components of this demanding and motivating program, inspired by the curricula of major international universities. A significant amount of time is devoted to projects and internships combining scientific specialization and personal development. A CMI is backed by a recognized research laboratory (ICube, Strasbourg) and involved in partnerships with companies.

At the end of the CMI IIRVIJ, graduate students obtain, in addition to the bachelor's degree in computer science and the master's degree in computer science (Image and 3D course), the label of the Figure network as well as a university diploma in the master's engineering course (CMI) - Computer Science, Image, Virtual Reality, Interactions and Games.

The objective is therefore to acquire a solid base of technical and scientific skills and a speciality, while developing personal and professional aptitudes through numerous simulation activities (projects, internships).
