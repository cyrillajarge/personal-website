DXOMARK Analyzer is the camera image and video quality measurement solution used by all the most prestigious camera manufacturers from professional equipment to cell phones. The team's technical expertise is recognized worldwide with participation in the drafting of international image quality standards such as ISO or IEEE and with the publication of scientific papers in international conferences such as Electronic Imaging, Image Sensor and Autosens.

<ins>**Subject**</ins>: Extension of image quality measurements (photo/video) to 10-bit depth. The objective of this course is to contribute to the extension of some (or possibly all) of the photo and video measurements to 10-bit depth images (the current solution being limited to 8-bit RGB images).

<ins>**Tasks**</ins>:

- In-depth study of HDR10 and HDR10+ video formats as well as RGB 10bits video formats.
- Analysis of the implemented image processing algorithms and their dependence on image depth.
- Creation of an image and video test database.
- Implementation of the necessary evolutions of the algorithms to add 10bits support, eventually by updating third-party software libraries.
- Validation of the measurement against the perceptual evalutaion of the test base images.

<ins>**Skills**</ins>:

- Development in Python.
- Development in C++.
- Technical english.
